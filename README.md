The Daily Life Budget app is designed to help users manage their daily expenses in different categories such as food, clothing, utilities, entertainment, transportation, and housing. The app provides a detailed overview of the user's expenses in each category and compares them to a pre-defined maximum amount set by the user. Users can add expenses to each category and track their spending over time using interactive charts and graphs. The app also provides alerts and notifications when the user exceeds their maximum spending limit in any category. With the Daily Life Budget app, users can easily stay on top of their daily expenses and take control of their finances.
